# An Adaptive Multi-Factor Approach to Traffic Signal Optimization Using Historical Data Analysis

## Abstract

This research presents a novel approach to traffic signal control through the implementation of an adaptive, multi-factor scheduling algorithm enhanced with historical data analysis. The system combines real-time traffic data with environmental conditions, temporal patterns, and historical trends to optimize signal timing patterns. Results demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow efficiency, with average wait times reduced by 27% and throughput increased by 23% compared to traditional fixed-time systems.
