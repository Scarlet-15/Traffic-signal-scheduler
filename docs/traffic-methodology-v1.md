# Methodology: Development of an Adaptive Multi-Factor Traffic Signal Control System

## 1. System Overview

This research presents a novel approach to traffic signal control through the implementation of an adaptive, multi-factor scheduling algorithm. The system utilizes real-time traffic data combined with environmental and temporal factors to optimize signal timing patterns, addressing the limitations of traditional fixed-time and vehicle-actuated control systems.

## 2. Core Components and Implementation

### 2.1 Vehicle Classification and Weighting System

#### Implementation
- Developed a hierarchical vehicle classification system with ten distinct categories
- Assigned weight coefficients based on vehicle size, passenger capacity, and road space utilization
- Weight values range from 1 (pedestrian) to 100 (heavy vehicles)

#### Rationale
- Reflects the disproportionate impact of different vehicle types on traffic flow
- Accounts for road space occupation and mobility characteristics
- Enables prioritization of high-occupancy vehicles

### 2.2 Time-Dependent Adjustment Framework

#### Implementation
- Incorporated time-of-day factors with three distinct periods:
  * Morning rush (6:00-9:00, factor: 1.5)
  * Evening rush (16:00-19:00, factor: 1.5)
  * Normal hours (factor: 1.0)
- Dynamic multiplication of base weights with time factors

#### Rationale
- Addresses varying traffic demands throughout the day
- Optimizes signal timing for peak periods
- Reduces unnecessary delays during off-peak hours

### 2.3 Congestion-Based Dynamic Scaling

#### Implementation
- Developed logarithmic scaling function: 1.0 + log₁₀(total_vehicles + 1) * 0.2
- Applied to aggregate vehicle counts per intersection
- Automatic adjustment based on real-time traffic density

#### Rationale
- Prevents exponential growth in heavy traffic situations
- Provides proportional response to increasing congestion
- Maintains system stability under varying load conditions

### 2.4 Weather-Responsive Adjustment System

#### Implementation
- Defined condition-specific multipliers:
  * Rain: 1.2
  * Snow: 1.3
  * Fog: 1.15
  * Normal: 1.0
- Automatic adjustment of green light durations based on weather conditions

#### Rationale
- Accounts for reduced visibility and traction
- Compensates for increased stopping distances
- Enhances safety during adverse weather conditions

### 2.5 Green Wave Optimization

#### Implementation
- Introduced 5-second offset between adjacent intersections
- Progressive timing adjustments based on vehicle progression speed
- Minimum duration constraints (15 seconds)
- Maximum duration constraints (120 seconds)

#### Rationale
- Facilitates continuous traffic flow through multiple intersections
- Reduces unnecessary stops and delays
- Prevents excessive wait times at any single intersection

## 3. Integration and Calculation Process
